# Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance: Print 1
# # to 1000.



# print(1)
# print(2)
# print(3)
# print(4)
# print(5)
# print(6)
# print(7)
# print(8)
# print(9)
# print(10)
# THe same TAsk can be done like this:
for i in range (1,11):
    print(i)
# This is called a loop. A loop allows us to repeat a set of statements multiple times without having to write them out again and again.


for i in range(1,1001):
    print(i)
