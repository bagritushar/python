# while loop is another way to create loops in Python. It continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.    
#Syntax:
# while (condition): # The block keeps executing until the condition is true
# #Body of the loop
# In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop
# is executed otherwise not!
# If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until
# the condition becomes False

while i <=10:
    print(i)
